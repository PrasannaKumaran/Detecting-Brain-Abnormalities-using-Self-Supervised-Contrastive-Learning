# Detecting Brain Abnormalities using Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning
The repository contains the source code for detecting brain abnormalities using self-supervised contrastive learning. This work focuses on the detection and classification of different types of hemorrhages and was submitted as our undergraduate thesis.

## Acknowledgement
We would like to thank and deep sense of gratitude to our guide Dr. CHITRA BABU, Professor, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, for her valuable advice and suggestions as well as her continued guidance, patience and support that helped us to shape and refine our work. We would like to thank Dr.U.S. SRINIVASAN, Senior Consultant Neurosurgeon, Sri Balaji hospital, Guindy, Chennai for providing the data and annotations for the project. We would like to extend our gratitude to him for helping us understand medical concepts.
